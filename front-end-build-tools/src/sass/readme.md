# SASS Structure
The SASS files are broken into the following orginzational...things (I ran out of words)

- `base` - global styles for things like, bold, underline, body, etc
- `components` - components can be defined as anything element that appears the same, or similar in multiple places on site
- `fonts` - icon fonts or regular ol' fonts belong here
- `mixins` - SASSy mixins, variables and the like
- `page` - styles for a specific page that has elements not repeated anywhere else
- `layouts` - structural styles, for example a page-type would classify as a layout (home, interior, media, etc.)
